        <h2>My Passion Is Playing Basketball</h2>
        <p>  Iam passionate about playing basketball because it connects me more to my grandma and mom. Since 6th grade I knew I wanted to play basketball. I was introduced to basketball by my middle school  coach and my mom. As I got older I got better and my mom was by my side the whole time. She pushed me to do better and work harder and smarter. As time went on basketball became the center of my life as well as school. My mom and great grandma were my biggest inspiration. Now itâ€™s just my mom. Playing basketball has opened so many doors for me. In the fall I will be going to college to play basketball and study medicine.
